jCarousel for WordPress implements the jCarousel as a WordPress plugin. It also displays a larger image size of the clicked item in the scroller or the first item that appears.

The plugin uses the shortcode [jcarousel_gallery] and supports all the standard gallery attributes.

It is is designed to be styled with CSS. Sample images for next/prev arrows are provided.

The plugin uses jQuery, and if your site doesn't already use jQuery, it'll add the script for you. 

It was inspired by Carousel Gallery by Joen.
